.Dt CLOSEFROM 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm closefrom
.Nd delete many descriptors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn closefrom "int fd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn closefrom
call deletes all descriptors numbered
.Fa fd
and higher from the per-process file descriptor table.
It is effectively the same as calling
.Xr close 2
on each descriptor.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
There is a compatible subset of the Solaris and
.Ox
versions of this function.
Follow the portable idiom:
.Bd -literal
	saved_errno = errno;
	do {
		errno = 0;
		closefrom(minfd);
	} while (errno == EINTR);
	errno = saved_errno;
.Ed
.Pp
Parts or the whole of the idiom may be omitted depending on the program.
Saving errno may be unnecessary,
and the function won't return EINTR if all signals are masked,
or if a delivered signal's sigaction structure has the SA_RESTART bit set.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn closefrom
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fd
is greater than all open file descriptors.
.It Bq Er EINTR
An interrupt was received.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn closefrom
is a
.Bx
and Solaris extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn closefrom
function first appeared in Solaris 9 and has been available since
.Ox 3.5 .
.Sh CAVEATS
This
.Ox
interface differs from the Solaris version in its return type,
consult Solaris documentation for more information.
.Sh BUGS
The libobsd version of this function isn't thread-safe. The Libobsd version
can't be interrupted or has bad interrupt latency in most platforms.
