.Sh NAME
.Nm reallocarray
.Nd array allocation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void *
.Fn reallocarray "void *ptr" "size_t nmemb" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Designed for safe allocation of arrays,
the
.Fn reallocarray
function is similar to
.Fn realloc
except it operates on
.Fa nmemb
members of size
.Fa size
and checks for integer overflow in the calculation
.Fa nmemb
*
.Fa size .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn reallocarray
returns a pointer to the allocated space; otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM .
.Pp
If
.Fa nmemb
or
.Fa size
is equal to 0, a unique pointer to a zero sized object is returned.
.Pp
If multiplying
.Fa nmemb
and
.Fa size
results in integer overflow,
.Fn reallocarray
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to
.Er ENOMEM .
.Sh IDIOMS
Consider
.Fn reallocarray
when there is multiplication in the
.Fa size
argument of
.Fn malloc
or
.Fn realloc .
For example, avoid this common idiom as it may lead to integer overflow:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if ((p = malloc(num * size)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
A drop-in replacement is the
.Ox
extension
.Fn reallocarray :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if ((p = reallocarray(NULL, num, size)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively,
.Fn calloc
may be used at the cost of initialization overhead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr calloc 3 ,
.Xr recallocarray 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn reallocarray
function appeared in
.Ox 5.6 .
